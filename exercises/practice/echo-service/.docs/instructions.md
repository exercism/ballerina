Creating a service in ballerina is easy. Now you can add a query parameter and a relative path.

The objectives:

- Modify the provided code
- It should have an echo endpoint that returns the value of a query parameter `sound`. The service should respond to a a GET HTTP request at the path `/echo?sound=hello`.
- It should have another endpoint to define the word "echo" that returns the string `"A sound or series of sounds caused by the reflection of sound waves from a surface back to the listener."`. The service should respond to a a GET HTTP request at the path `/echo/definition`.

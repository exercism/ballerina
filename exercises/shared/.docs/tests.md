# Tests

To run the tests, run the command `bal test --offline` from within the exercise directory.

## Skipped tests

Initially, only the first test will be enabled.
This is to encourage you to solve the exercise one step at a time.
Once you get the first test passing, remove the `enable: false` property from the next test and work on getting that test passing.

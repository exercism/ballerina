# Instructions

Calling APIs is an important part of writing code on the internet. In this exercise, you will need to fetch data from an endpoint and ensure it was retrieved successfully.

## Objectives

- Modify the provided code.
- Invoke the HTTP client and try to retrieve a quote. This result should be a union type consisting `string` and `error`.
- If the quote is received, print it to the console (using `io:println()`).
- If an `error` has occurred, print the error message to the console.
